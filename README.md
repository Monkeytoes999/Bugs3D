# Bugs3D
A totally original idea that isn't just an evolution of an evolution of one of my previous ideas


## How to Bugs 3D
1. Go to the GitHub - you're already here!
2. Navigate to the 'main' branch for the latest version. This should be the default landing place.
3. Download both .zip files and extract them into the same base folder. There are two .zips due to UnityPlayer.dll being a bit massive and github is a bit mad about file sizes. After this step, you should have a folder that looks like this:

5. Launch Bugs 3D using the .exe file!
6. Shoot at those... very... blobby. . . things - indefinitely! Or until you die, but you can always restart and get back on that infinite grind.
